# Amazon Clone

This is a full-stack web application that aims to replicate the functionality of the popular online shopping platform, Amazon. The project utilizes a variety of technologies, including:

- **Next.js** for server-rendered React application development
- **Redux** for state management
- **Stripe** for handling checkout and payments
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Firebase** for database and authentication
- **Next-Auth** for user authentication and authorization

Users can browse through products and add them to their basket. If they are logged in, they can proceed to the checkout page where they can make a payment using Stripe. After the checkout, they can see their orders in the Orders page.
